    "## Instructions:\n",
    "In this assignment, you will apply **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** as a preprocessing step to the **MNIST dataset** and train a **logistic regression classifier**. You will compare the model performance and training time when using different levels of SVD for dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will need to:\n",
    "1. Load the MNIST dataset and normalize it.\n",
    "2. Perform SVD and reduce the dimensions of the data.\n",
    "3. Train a logistic regression model on the original and SVD-reduced data.\n",
    "4. Measure and compare the training time and accuracy of the model with varying SVD components.\n",
    "5. Plot the results and analyze how SVD impacts the performance and efficiency of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "Your tasks include:\n",
    "1. Implement SVD algorithm. You are not allowed to directly use SVD implemented by other packages, but you may use functions in NumPy. (Part 2)\n",
    "2. Explore the accuracy and time performance from different numbers of SVD components. (Part 4)\n",
    "3. Visualize the accuracy, time performance and top 5 singular vectors in the dataset, analyze and explain which number of SVD component looks best to you? (Part 4,5&6) Hint: singular vectors should be reshaped to 28x28 images for visualization.\n",

    "\n",
    "The results from the graph reveal that there's  trade-offs between model accuracy and training time. As the number of components increases from 20 to 100, accuracy improves from 0.88 to 0.92, with diminishing returns beyond 50 components. However, training time also increases significantly, from 2 seconds with 20 components to 20 seconds with 100 components. The optimal balance is around 50 components, offering high accuracy (~0.91) with reasonable training time (~7 seconds). This choice provides a good compromise between performance and computational efficiency, though the final decision depends on specific application requirements and available resources."
